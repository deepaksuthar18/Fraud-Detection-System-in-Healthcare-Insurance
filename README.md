# Fraud-Detection-System-in-Healthcare-Insurance

This project is a Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection System built using Machine Learning and deployed with a Streamlit web app.

📚 Project Description
Healthcare fraud is a serious issue causing huge financial losses. This project aims to detect different types of frauds in healthcare insurance claims, such as:

Ghost Enrolled: Fake patients created to claim benefits.

Phantom Billing: Billing for services never provided.

Fake Treatment: Billing for unnecessary or fake treatments.

No Fraud: Genuine claims.

We have developed and trained machine learning models to predict whether a claim is fraudulent and, if so, what type of fraud it is.
